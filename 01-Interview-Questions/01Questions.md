## What hiring manager is looking for
- **Testing Knowledge**: Understand the basic testing concepts and the testing process
- **Creative Test Case Generation**: Ability to generate test cases for different scenarios
- **Passion for Testing**: Show your passion for testing and how you can improve the testing process

## General approach to any question
1. Ask thoughtful questions to understand the problem
2. Break down the problem into smaller parts
   1. Behavioral Questions: STAR method (Situations, Tasks, Actions, Results)
3. Complete the answer
4. Optimize the solution if possible
5. Smile and have fun!

### Test a pen
1. Know the customer and product
   - Customer: Know who will use the product
     - School: art students? how dark/thick? age of student?
     - Office: how long will it be used? how many times per day?
     - Prison: can't be used as a weapon
     - Intelnational: what language? which color?
   - Product: Know the requirements and product
     - How it works: how to use it? how to refill it?
     - What components it has: ink, pen tip, pen body, pen cap, pen cli
2. Creative Test Case Generation
   - Functional Test
     - Write on different surfaces: paper, glass, wood, skin
     - Write in different environments: hot, cold, wet, dry
     - Write in different positions: vertical, horizontal, upside down
     - Negative Test
       - Drop it from different heights
       - Write on skin, under water, metal or glass
   - Non-functional Test
     - Performance: how long can it be used before sharpening? how many times can it be used? temperature, bend break point?
     - Security: can't be used as a weapon, lead toxicity?
     - Usability: how easy to use? how easy to refill?
     - Accessibility: can be used by left-handed people? hand/finger size? feels different for different people?
     - Internationalization: can be used in different languages? colors offensive to the culture?
3. Optimize the answer
   - Use automation to test the performance
   - Use different tools to test the lead toxicity
   - Use different people to test the usability and accessibility

### Practice!Practice!Practice!
- Test an app/functionalities/random objects
- Count the number of test cases you can generate
- Record yourself and review the video
  - Keep trying if you can't generate enough test cases for at least 10 minutes
