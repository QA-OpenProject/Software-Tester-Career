1. What's the most important when we make the API testing?
   - Functional Testing
     - API Endpoints accept valid input and return the expected output
     - API Endpoints reject invalid input and return the appropriate error message
   - Validation of Input and Output
     - Input's parameters and payload are validated, then verify the correctness of the response data returned by the API.
     - Checking data formats, data types, data integrity, and adherence to any validation rules specified by the API contract
   - Authorization and Authentication
     - 
   - API Contract Testing
     - Verify that the API adheres to its contract or specification, such as OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) documentation or API blueprints. 
   - Security Testing
   - Performance Testing
   - Reliability and Error Handling
   - Integration Testing
   - Documentation and Reporting
